# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1. **Prevalidation:** Check if the current directory is already a CodeGuide Starter Pro project by looking for a `package.json` and configuration files (e.g., Tailwind, Next.js). *[Project Summary: Starter Kit]*
2. **Starter Kit Initialization:** If not already initialized, instruct the user to create a new repository using the template at [CodeGuide Starter Pro](https://github.com/codeGuide-dev/codeguide-starter-pro). *[Project Summary: Starter Kit]*
3. **Node.js Check:** Verify Node.js v20.2.1 is installed by running `node -v`. *[Tech Stack: Core Tools]*
4. **Xcode Setup:** Ensure Xcode is installed (for iPhone optimization and testing). *[Tech Stack: Development/Deployment]*
5. **Next.js Installation:** Install Next.js 14 (note: Next.js 14 is recommended for optimal integration with current AI coding tools and LLM models). Use the command:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@14 my-ai-voice-bot
   ```
   *[Tech Stack: Frontend]*
6. **Project Directory Validation:** Navigate into the new project directory and run `npm run dev` to validate that the development server launches on `localhost`. *[Validation: Environment Setup]*

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

7. **Tailwind CSS Setup:** Install and configure Tailwind CSS. Create a `tailwind.config.js` file in the project root and add the necessary content paths. *[Tech Stack: Frontend]
8. **Shadcn UI Integration:** Install Shadcn UI components and integrate them into the project. Create a `/components` directory for reusable UI components. *[Tech Stack: Frontend]*
9. **Home Screen UI:** Build a minimalist, glass-inspired home screen in `/pages/index.tsx` optimized for iPhone browsers. Include a prominent "Start Conversation" button. *[User Flow: Home Screen]*
10. **API Key Modal:** Create an API key input component at `/components/ApiKeyModal.tsx`. This component should present an input field for the user’s OpenAI API key and securely store it in `localStorage`. *[Key Features: API Key Authentication]*
11. **Voice Interaction Component:** Create a component at `/components/VoiceChat.tsx` that implements both browser-native Speech-to-Text (for capturing user voice) and Text-to-Speech (for outputting responses). *[Key Features: Voice Interaction]*
12. **Component Integration:** Add the `VoiceChat` component to the home screen so that when the user taps "Start Conversation", the voice conversation session starts, initiating speech recognition and later text-to-speech playback after API response. *[User Flow: Voice Input]*
13. **Browser API Testing:** Validate that the browser’s Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs function correctly by testing on an iPhone simulator or browser emulator (e.g., via Xcode). *[Non-Functional Requirements: Usability, Performance]*

## Phase 3: Backend Development

14. **API Route Creation:** In the Next.js project, create an API route at `/pages/api/chat.ts` using Typescript. This endpoint will handle POST requests from the frontend to process conversation messages. *[Key Features: OpenAI Realtime API Integration]*
15. **OpenAI API Integration:** In `/pages/api/chat.ts`, implement logic to receive transcribed text and the user-supplied OpenAI API key, and then call OpenAI’s Realtime API to obtain a response. Ensure that network calls are optimized for near-instantaneous processing (sub 1-2 second latency). *[Non-Functional Requirements: Performance]*
16. **Error Handling:** Add robust error handling within the API route to catch issues such as connectivity problems or invalid/expired API keys, returning clear error messages. *[Key Features: Error Handling; Non-Functional Requirements: Reliability]*
17. **Endpoint Validation:** Test the API endpoint by sending a sample POST request (using curl or Postman) and verify that it returns the expected response. For example:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "Hello"}'
   ```
   *[Validation: Backend Development]*

## Phase 4: Voice Customization

18. **Voice Selection Interface:** Add a settings panel to the VoiceChat component that allows users to select from available system voices. *[Key Features: Voice Interaction]*
19. **Speech Rate and Pitch Controls:** Implement sliders for adjusting speech rate and pitch to customize the voice output. *[Key Features: Voice Interaction]*
20. **Voice Settings Persistence:** Store user voice preferences in localStorage to maintain settings between sessions. *[Key Features: Local Data Storage]*
21. **TypeScript Integration:** Create proper type definitions for the Web Speech API to ensure type safety and better developer experience. *[Tech Stack: Core Tools]*
22. **Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation explaining the voice customization features, browser compatibility, and troubleshooting tips. *[Project Summary: Documentation]*

## Phase 5: Integration

23. **Frontend-Backend Connection:** In the `VoiceChat` component, implement a call (using `fetch` or `axios`) to the `/api/chat` endpoint when a voice message is ready to be sent. Include the stored API key in the request payload. *[User Flow: API Processing; Key Features: API Key Authentication]*
24. **Local Data Storage:** Implement logic in the frontend to store the conversation data locally (e.g., in `localStorage`) for the duration of the session. *[Key Features: Local Data Storage]*
25. **Full Flow Validation:** Conduct an end-to-end test by simulating a voice conversation. Validate that speech is captured, transcribed text is sent to the API, the API response is received and converted to speech, and that all conversation data is stored locally. *[Validation: Integration]*

## Phase 6: Deployment

26. **Vercel Deployment:** Deploy the Next.js project to Vercel using the provided Vercel configuration. Ensure that the app runs securely over HTTPS. *[Tech Stack: Deployment]*
27. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., via GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment of the project. *[Tech Stack: Deployment]*
28. **Final Validation:** After deployment, conduct end-to-end tests on actual iPhone devices or simulators to confirm that voice interaction, API calls, and UI responsiveness meet performance and usability standards. *[Non-Functional Requirements: Performance, Usability]*
29. **Documentation:** Document any known limitations (e.g., potential API rate limits, browser compatibility issues) and outline areas for future enhancements such as Supabase integration or advanced authentication with Clerk Auth. *[Project Summary: Potential Pitfalls; Constraints and Assumptions]*
