# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

This project is centered around building an AI-powered voice conversational bot that allows users, specifically product designers, to interact with OpenAI’s Realtime API using natural voice commands. The application leverages browser-native speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities so that when a user speaks, the question is transcribed in real time, sent to the API for processing, and then the response is converted back into audio. The minimalist, clean glass interface ensures the user experience is modern and intuitive, making it easy to start a conversation with just a button press.

The purpose of this project is to provide product designers with a quick, accessible tool for obtaining information and insights without needing to type. The key objectives include ensuring a seamless end-to-end conversational experience, maintaining local data storage for quick access and privacy, and leveraging native iPhone browser functionalities for an efficient voice interface. Success will be measured by user ease-of-use, speed of response, and the overall fluidity of the voice conversation experience.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   A single-page interface optimized for mobile iPhone browsers.
*   Voice activation via a clear, designated button.
*   Use of browser-native APIs for speech-to-text and text-to-speech.
*   Real-time communication with OpenAI’s Realtime API for processing queries.
*   Local storage of conversation data on the user's device.
*   Minimalistic, glass-inspired design that is sleek and modern.
*   Handling API key authentication by allowing the user to supply their OpenAI API key.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Multi-session conversation history management beyond local, in-session storage.
*   Advanced conversational enhancements such as multi-language support or user-specific personalization beyond a one-time session.
*   User account creation or complex authentication systems (beyond the use of an OpenAI API key).
*   Server-side storage or complex backend data persistence.
*   Extra features such as real-time analytics or extended API integrations not directly related to voice conversation.

## 3. User Flow

A new user lands on a beautifully designed homepage that showcases a clean, minimalist glass interface, specifically optimized for iPhone browsers. On the screen, the user is immediately presented with a single, prominent button that invites them to start a conversation. When the user taps this button, the system launches the browser’s native speech-to-text feature, allowing the user to speak naturally. The spoken input is then captured and transcribed in real time.

After capturing the voice input, the transcribed text is immediately sent to OpenAI’s Realtime API for processing. Once an appropriate response is received, the system utilizes the browser’s native text-to-speech functionality to deliver the reply audibly. Meanwhile, the conversation data is stored locally on the device, ensuring that any necessary details remain available during the session without sending data to external servers.

## 4. Core Features

*   **Voice Interaction Module:**

    *   Uses browser-native APIs for both speech-to-text (capturing user voice input) and text-to-speech (delivering audio responses).
    *   Provides a simple and responsive user interface with a single clear call-to-action button.

*   **Realtime API Integration:**

    *   Sends transcribed text to OpenAI’s Realtime API and handles the API response.
    *   Manages API key authentication by expecting a user-supplied key.

*   **Local Data Handling:**

    *   Stores conversation data locally on the user’s device to allow the session to run smoothly without relying on external databases.

*   **UI/UX Design:**

    *   Implements a minimalistic, glass-inspired design with modern visual elements.
    *   Specifically optimized for mobile (iPhone) use, ensuring responsive design and clear navigation.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js coupled with Tailwind CSS and Typescript to ensure modern, responsive design and efficient code management.

*   **Backend & API Interaction:** Integration with OpenAI’s Realtime API. Although complex backend storage isn’t required, minimal handling may be facilitated via tools like Supabase if needed.

*   **Design and UI Components:** Shadcn UI for component styling that aligns with a clean, glass-inspired aesthetic.

*   **Voice and Speech Management:** Use of browser-native speech-to-text and text-to-speech APIs.

*   **Development Tools:**

    *   V0 by Vercel for an AI-powered frontend component builder.
    *   Xcode for potential mobile-specific optimizations and testing on iPhone devices.

*   **Additional Libraries:** Integration with OpenAI and possible use of utility functions for handling API requests, error handling, and smooth interaction.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** The application should provide near-instantaneous processing of voice inputs and API responses with minimal latency, aiming for response times under 1-2 seconds for a fluid conversation.
*   **Security:** API key management should be secure, ensuring that the user’s OpenAI API key is handled carefully and not exposed in the frontend code. All API interactions must follow secure HTTP protocols.
*   **Usability:** A clean and minimalistic design ensures ease-of-use. The UI should function intuitively on mobile devices, especially iPhones.
*   **Reliability:** The system must gracefully handle any interruptions in API connectivity or browser API failures by providing appropriate error messages or fallbacks.
*   **Scalability:** While the current scope is limited to single-session interactions and local storage, the application should be designed with clean separation of modules in case future enhancements are required.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The application is built exclusively for mobile iPhone browsers, meaning responsive design must target small-screen devices.
*   It assumes the availability and reliability of browser-native APIs for speech-to-text and text-to-speech.
*   The solution depends on the OpenAI Realtime API being available and properly managed with a user-supplied API key.
*   Data is stored locally, implying that there are no complex server-side dependencies or storage concerns.
*   No advanced authentication system or multi-session management is included, staying true to the minimal viable product specifications.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   API Connectivity: There might be API rate limitations or connectivity issues with OpenAI’s Realtime API. Mitigation can include error handling and notifying the user when the API is temporarily unavailable.
*   Browser Compatibility: Relying on browser-native speech and text functionalities, which may vary between different iOS versions or browser environments. Ensuring thorough testing on multiple iPhone models and iOS versions is necessary.
*   Local Storage Management: Storing data locally may lead to data loss if the session ends unexpectedly. Although the design supports single-session interactions, guidelines for local cache management should be established.
*   Dependency on User-Provided API Key: Since the system uses an API key supplied by the user, handling incorrect or expired keys appropriately is essential to maintain a smooth user experience.
*   Minimalistic Design Trade-offs: While the clean, glass-inspired interface is central to the product experience, ensuring that this design doesn’t compromise usability is crucial. Regular usability testing can help mitigate potential design issues.
